# CHI 2019: Mon 11AM in Crown Plaza Shuna/Staffa
Join us at CHI! Our SIG on Learning, Education, & Families is on **Monday, 11:00-12:20 in the Crown Plaza Shuna/Staffa room** (known as Island A CROWNE on the [online CHI program](https://chi2019.acm.org/web-program.php?sessionId=490ec4bc0189dea42e8ec387497673627b71a070ab3a703facadd7cf4f7a6725))

# Overview
A CHI 2019 special interest group (SIG) to support HCI in learning and educational contexts. 

This SIG will bring together researchers, educators, and practitioners with three goals in mind: 
1. Discussing more inclusive cross-disciplinary perspectives on learning.
2. Defining future directions and standards for learning and education contributions in CHI.
3. Building community across research/practice boundaries.

We are proposing this SIG in response to a growing interest in learning-related papers, as signaled by a 40% increase in CHI submissions relating to learning in recent years and the creation of the _Learning, Education, and Families_ subcommittee for CHI 2019.
