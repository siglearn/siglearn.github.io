**To better support the learning sciences within the HCI domain, we plan to create a special interest group (SIG) for [CHI 2019](https://chi2019.acm.org/)**. We are researchers and practitioners with an interest in designing and understanding experiences that foster learning in a broad sense.

We are proposing this SIG in response to a growing interest in learning-related papers, as signaled by an increase in papers that mention learning at CHI in recent years and the creation of the families and learning subcommittee for CHI 2019.
